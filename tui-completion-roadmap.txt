COMPLETION MILESTONES:
======================
25% - Bug fixes + Core infrastructure + Basic widgets (text, button, input)
50% - + Layout system + Advanced widgets (scroll, list, menu)
75% - + Interaction system + Advanced features (themes, animation)
100% - + All utilities, testing, examples, and optimization

CURRENT STATUS: ~25% (Foundation stage)
NEXT PRIORITY: Fix bugs, then implement event handling system
